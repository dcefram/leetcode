# leetcode
a compilation of my solutions because leetcode decided to erase all of my solved solutions :|

I intended ot get back on my initial naive implementations to try to optimize them, but poof, they're not there. The problem's status is "solved",
but my solution was erased and reset back to the default state -_-
